# Quantum Annealing
## Introduction
Optimization indeed plays an indispensable role in any machine learning and deep learning algorithms. As the post-quantum computing era's surge, quantum computers' computational power becomes more dominant in diverse computing problems; quantum machine learning and quantum deep learning (QML/QDL) have drawn unprecedented attention research community. Unlike classical approaches, QML/QDL requires a distinct optimization strategy called quantum annealing (QA), also known as alloy, crystallization, or tempering. This blog will introduce the fundamental physic problem that motivates quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) and its quantum solution in Section 3. Moreover, a brief survey on the advantage of QA will be addressed in Section 2, followed by several potential research directions, which will be discussed in Section 3.
